# FitLit Abstract

The Fitlit application is an app that provides the user with a wide variety of information relating to fitness activities.  Currently this information is being pulled from a data set of different categorized information, but as it evolves, it would eventually reach a point where it is extracting that information directly from a users fitness device such as a fitbit or anything else that keeps a large collection of the users activity data.
## Visual demonstration of the app being used.

### Display of random user's fitness activity and information.

Here we can see what display information is contained in the application for a random user. Their data is tied together by their ID Number property and it allows all that user's relevant information the be extracted onto the webpage.

## Install/Setup

In order to setup the application, you will need to go to <https://github.com/melissasteele09/fitlit> in order to retrieve the necessary files.  Click on the green 'Clone or download' button and copy the https address.  Open your terminal and change directories into where you would like to install the application and run 'git clone (paste address you copied)' and hit return.  Change into the directory and open the index.html file found in the src folder.  It will have a randomly generated user's information on display and to change that, you can change the current users ID number to whichever one you are looking for and it will update the information accordingly.
